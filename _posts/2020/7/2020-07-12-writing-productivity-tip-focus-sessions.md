description: "I'm trying out a new writing productivity tip that seems to be working fairly well for me: focus sessions. A writing focus session is a one-hour session focused on a writing task. I made a goal last week of doing four writing focus sessions (at work) each day. I figured I should at least be able to devote of my work day as a professional technical writing doing writing. This technique boosted my writing productivity last week."

I recorded a short videocast for this post:

## Session length

I found that four hours, divided into one-hour sessions, is about perfect, and it keeps me much more on track. Ideally, for each focus session, one should turn off email and chat clients for the duration of the session. If you really want to focus and get in the zone, that's a good approach. However, I tend to leave email and chat on. If I find myself getting drawn into some other task, I just stop the timer. The presence of the timer reminds me of my task and helps me focus even if I'm temporarily pulled over into other tasks.

## Timer software

I use a macOS app called [Focus - Time Management](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/focus-time-management/id777233759?mt=12) for my timer. It works fairly well, but there are dozens of other timers to choose from, including non-app timers as well. The app works well because it appears on my screen in a more prominent way. When I see it counting down, it reminds me to stay on task. It also lets me customize the duration and number of the focus sessions.

## What counts as writing

I consider *writing* to include any activity geared towards finish the writing task. This could involve tasks such as reading design documents, interfacing with engineers, experimenting with a sample app, or even going through an e-learning course to learn more about some essential aspect related to the feature you're documenting. As long as these supporting activities are necessary for you to complete the writing task, they should be considered part of the writing process. (Otherwise, writing is basically typing.)

What wouldn't be considered "writing"? Some examples might be calendar planning, meetings, internal team documentation, reviewing and responding to general email, attending standups, reviewing candidate writing samples, renewing software licenses, fixing computer issues, peer reviews, and such. Exactly what is and isn't writing isn't always clear, but the gist of my technique is that the task should be necessary for you to complete the specific writing task.

## Keeping glue tasks in check

One reason I like the four-hour time is that it helps keep time spent on "glue tasks" in check. For more about glue, see [Being glue](https://noidea.dog/glue) by Tanya Reilly. Tanya describes how engineers expected to write code are often derailed into many supporting tasks that are important but for which they receive little recognition. For example:

* Setting up team meetings
* Establishing coding standards
* Improving team processes
* Mentoring & coaching
* Improving onboarding

Tanya found she was excellent at doing these glue tasks, but they detracted from her coding time. Her calendar started to fill up with glue:

<a href="https://noidea.dog/#/glue/"><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/how_spending_finite_work_hrs.jpeg" alt="Too busy to code" /></a>

With a calendar like this, how do you find time to code? And if you don't have significant code that you're pushing out, how are you valued/recognized/promoted?

Her advice is that if these glue tasks count towards your promotion or otherwise fit into your career trajectory, great, keep doing them. But if spending time on glue tasks removes your time from coding, and all management cares about is the code you push out, then consider cutting back on glue.

I think that focusing half my day on writing tasks helps me keep an appropriate balance between important tasks versus supporting glue tasks. (Also, this assumes your role is an individual contributor rather than a manager. Many of the more promotion-worthy tasks ironically tend to require non-writing projects, but this discussion is veering off into another direction.)

## Other concerns become smaller

I noticed that if I can knock out a lot of writing tasks, other issues no longer become issues. For example, I might not need to spend extra meetings trying to prioritize my project load, push out timelines, decide where to cut corners, and such.

Also, many times writing tasks take less time than I think. I often have doc tasks that I procrastinate and push off, but when I finally sit down to do them, the task only takes a couple of hours. Afterwards, I think, why did I wait so long to do this? It wasn't so bad.

Do you have any writing productivity tips? If so, feel free to share them below. Also note that this technique ties into a larger technique called the [Pomodoro Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique). If you haven't heard of this technique, check it out sometime.
