description: "I updated the Introduction to API documentation topic in my API doc course in two major ways. First, I expanded on the many different types of APIs out there (beyond REST). Second, I incorporated research from Smartbear's <a href='https://static1.smartbear.co/smartbearbrand/media/pdf/smartbear_state_of_api_2019.pdf'>2019 State of API report."
