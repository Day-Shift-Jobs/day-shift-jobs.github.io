If you've been following my blog, you know that this past year I've started a series of API documentation workshops that I'm organizing on my own. Yesterday I finished teaching a workshop in Los Angeles, California, to a group of 15 people. I know that some readers get tired of me posting about API doc topics all the time, so here I'll focus on a topic I've never actually addressed: event planning. It turns out event planning is kind of fascinating.

Before this workshop I had the privilege of eating dinner with Jack Molisani, conference organizer extraordinaire for Lavacon, and I got to peer inside the mind of someone who has mastered the art of event planning. In this post, I'll share a few tips that I learned from Jack.

##  Targeting an audience

With Lavacon, Jack focuses on a specific market segment: content strategy and tech comm management. Lavacon's conference attendees are senior writers/managers solving strategic content problems across the enterprise, and they often interact with upper-level execs. This is the first lesson in event planning: define an audience niche for your event. Not just "technical writers," but "senior content strategists" or something.

With my API doc workshops, I have a specific focus &mdash; tech writers working with APIs in developer docs. Having a narrowly defined audience helps you focus content for that audience. In contrast, conferences that address tech comm in general tend to be so wide and diverse that even with 10 sessions at once, you might find that none of them really seem relevant. With a narrower audience, you can have fewer tracks or topics and still have relevant content.

## Choosing a location

Besides the niche focus, another element in event planning is picking the right location. I sort of made a mistake in picking LA as a location. I thought LA had more of a tech focus, but it doesn't. Irvine does. I should have held the workshop in Irvine (just 45 min. away), but for whatever reason I ended up steering it more towards LAX. I can't even remember why except to accommodate those flying in. Apparently, some years ago during a tech comm crash, many tech companies in LA moved elsewhere. It's crazy that a 1 hour flight (distance from SF to LA) can make so much difference with demographics, but it does.

On a plus side, some of the LA participants have some deep experience in the industry and are really interesting people to talk to. We still had 15 people, which some feel is the perfect size for a workshop like this.

Overall, when deciding on locations, you might hear from a few people in the area who express interest in the topic, which might lead you to think there is wider interest in the area as well. But is there? It's difficult to gauge interest in an area in a more data-driven way.

I asked Jack how he decides which locations to choose for his conferences, or what methods I could use to better pick locations for API doc workshops. He said it's fairly easy: do searches on Indeed for the skills your event/workshop focuses on, e.g., "API technical writer." Look at this data to determine your locations. Where employers are looking for candidates with these skills, there will be a natural interest for events focusing on those skills. Duh! It's so obvious but I didn't even think about this.

Last year I actually attempted to do research about locations, and I wrote an article called [Best locations for API documentation jobs](/learnapidoc/jobapis_location.html). I tallied up technical writers employed in various areas (based on the STC Salary Database) and correlated them with hits for "API" on Indeed, and then ranked the areas. I know the approach was rudimentary, but it's hard to pinpoint where API doc jobs are because these jobs don't necessary have API in the title. At any rate, the top trending states were California, Texas, Virginia, Massachusetts, and New York.

What about Boston? Jack says that's an expensive city, which can detract participants. If it costs several hundred dollars just to book a hotel, take that into consideration. Then again, if people are already in Boston, the hotel might not be an issue.

Which brings me to a key point: Conferences differ from workshops in significant ways. A multi-day conference can be held in an interesting, non-tech-hub city like Portland in part because people traveling to the area might be drawn to the area itself. You don't see many conferences held in Des Moines, Jack said.

One-day workshops aren't multi-day getaways, and even if I held my conference in a fun, non-tech-hub location (not even sure where), it likely wouldn't draw people. A conference has a different dynamic at play in terms of location. Jack even holds some conferences in Hawaii, even.

## Choosing the date

Another factor to consider is the timing. Jack told me about his experiences putting on a conference in Dublin. It seemed like a great fit due to the strong tech comm presence in the area. But he accidentally held the first conference on a federal holiday when everyone was out of town.

Jack said that among difference conference organizers, there can sometimes be competition with dates. Suppose a competing conference aligns their dates with your event? What then?

Since I'm only holding one day workshops, I don't run into this same issue of competing workshops. But I do try to avoid clashing with the same date as another tech comm conference. How do you know when all major events are? Not just tech comm events but other events in the city (like Dreamforce) that might conflict?

Even better yet, how do you know when the best time of year is to hold an event? People travel in the summer, vacation during Christmas, relax with family during Thanksgiving, stay home with kids during spring break, etc. Mix these holidays with all the different tech comm conference dates, the different non-tech-comm event dates, and then look for dates actually available at the venues you want. Picking a date is no easy choice!

Fortunately, a one-day workshop is much less involved than a multi-day conference, so there's not as much risk in date planning. Pick the wrong date and worst case scenario, you end up paying the fee for the venue (usually ~$1,000). Pick the wrong date for a conference, and you could be out thousands of dollars, since the venues are often large hotels you have to book years in advance.

I'm still learning how to pick the right dates. One thing is for sure: there's no easier way to make an enemy in this space than by planning your event on top of another event.

## Surprise, planning events is fun

There's an aspect of event planning that I didn't expect &mdash; it's fun. Deciding which city to go to, and which venue to pick, which agenda to follow, and then announcing it is all kind of a rush. Jack is extremely good at this. In his military days, he managed a lot of contracts. Contracts are at the heart of event planning, as you have to contract with venues, speakers, exhibitors, caterers, and more.

Actually, Jack said he's planning to write a book that contains much of what he has learned about event planning. I would be excited to read this. Jack was lively and engaged telling me all of these tips and challenges and other experiments he's followed over the years.

I admit that I have fun browsing Peerspace for various venues. It's not difficult to find a classroom-style meeting room that would hold about 25 people, equipped with AV equipment for presentations. There's a whole economy shaped around different businesses renting out meeting spaces, not too unlike Airbnb.

There are a lot of details to keep track of in invent planning. I mentioned location, venue, date, catering, but there are also a host of other details. I don't have ambitions to plan larger events other than workshops. Although I think a conference on API docs would certainly draw me, I know that larger event planning pretty much consumes all of your time. Jack said that planning two major conferences a year is more than double the work but triple or more, as you have to constantly coordinate and separate details between the two.

I like the idea of workshops. Workshops are one-day events, convenient to participants, focused on specific skills. I did find that the more focused learning and writing about APIs prior to this workshop bumped up my motivation for the event considerably. The content needs to keep evolving. I'm thinking of specializing the next workshop to focus on API doc tools for authoring and publishing. Yeah, there's really a full-day that one could spend on this topic.

## Synergies with complementary business streams

There are two more interesting pieces of advice, or observations really, that I gleaned from Jack. Jack not only organizes conferences but also does staffing for tech companies. At first I didn't see how the two activities related but as he explained how many people reach out to him to fill positions after attending his conferences, or how people who use his staffing agency end up attending the conferences, I could see how these two businesses build and feed off of each other. He also said that having two streams like this helps safeguard in case one lags. Suppose the conference has low attendance one year -- he isn't entirely dependent on that income stream alone. It's like a farmer with a diversity of crops and other income.

I struggled to see how my workshops could build on another business activity like this. Some have recommended that I create some kind of API writer recommendation service, but I have no desire for that, as it's extremely hard to vouch for specific candidates without knowing and working with them. However, I do see some interactivity between API doc workshops and API tools advertising. Advertising has been fairly successful as a supplementary pocket-change (or rather, one-month's rent in California) type of activity. I could look to expand the way these two business activities intersect, perhaps.

## When your ship comes in

As a final piece of advice, Jack mentioned a philosophy about putting yourself out there without knowing exactly what the returns will be. There's a phrase called "when your ship comes in," which refers to an unexpected boon. Jack's philosophy is to constantly put himself out there, whether it involves writing articles, speaking, going to conferences, or doing other activities. When he does this, unexpected boons come in. For example, a big name might suddenly ask to speak at one of his upcoming conferences. Or from a video shared on Linkedin, a company might reach out to Jack to get help filling a position. You never quite know what comes of it.

I find this philosophy interesting. When I publish a blog post, I don't do so with any expectations. For example, I have no idea what will come back to me as a result of this blog post. Maybe nothing. But more often than not, unexpected things do happen. For me, blogging seems to align nicely with a built-in marketing for the workshops. Nearly everywhere I go, people seem to know me from some post they've read. Whether that post reflects my current thoughts or even puts me in a positive light, I don't know. But my life has been a constant act of putting myself out there -- publishing not just blog posts, but presentations, podcasts, tweets, and other interactions. Good things usually come back in for me, in ways I don't often expect. For example, I think one post I wrote persuaded a senior manager at Amazon to hire me before I even started the interview process. That's always nice &mdash; getting people aligned ahead of time. Others who have attended my workshops say they've been reading my blog for years. And of course there are others who simply stumble across me, like a Rwandan engineer who searched for workshops in LA on Eventbrite during his trip here.
