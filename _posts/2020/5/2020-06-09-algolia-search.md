static site gens pose new challenge. tools no longer all-in-one that include search. figure out your own search, more or less.

search always a kind of black box to me. never really dug into this, despite findability being key and central to the help experience.

not sure how search can be so important but also easy overlooked. in part it's b/c google takes care of this. without google, there would be more pressure on sites to provide better search. but now your site can easily get by without it.

why do people even use site search instead of google? maybe they narrow down the domain and want to know what info your site has on the topic. they could do a site search on google but maybe a site search will provide better results?

one strategy is to abdicate all search efforts to google and rely on its tech for findability. problem is that google serves up ads, often from competitors. also requires users to specify the domain they are searching. and then it's unclear how google's algorithm entirely works, so you can try to SEO your own content.

diving into SEO on google might be the most worthwhile effort, returning more bang for your buck than creating an internal search. for sure we have to have this in mind when analyzing search.

but it seems like there's more opportunity. site search could be better. for example, you could provide facets for users to filter against, or micro content in the results. you can collect search analytics, or provide a quick findability mechanism directly on your site that doesn't involve looking like google.

some examples: balsamiq, xfinity site. compare the two. xfinity looks cheap. if i wanted to search google, wouldn't i just go to google? so there's SEO but also site search. maybe don't confuse the two. however, we're then optimizing against different algorithms.

one main task is to understand search algorithm and then optimize content for it. with google, you optimize your content to match their algorithm, as best as you can understand it. with custom search engine, you can probably optimize the search engine to fit your content.

example with algolia and facets. you tell it which attributes to index, and then you can work wonders with the facets.

which facets do you index? what facets does google index? google does have some standard fields but does it make use of them? why not index the same facets?

algolia really different in this respect. kudos for ability to index so
