Cruce Sanders at <a href='simplea.com'>[A]</a> recently interviewed me for his podcast series Towards a Smarter World. The episode is called <i>Unifying Technical Content Sets into a Broader Ecosystem</i>, and we chat about some issues I wrote about in an article about agile teams and enterprise content strategy.
