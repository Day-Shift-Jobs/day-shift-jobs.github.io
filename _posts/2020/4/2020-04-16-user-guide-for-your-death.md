This is a morbid topic but one that until recently I'd never even considered. When you die, what user manual will your family members follow to carry out tasks that need to be done? Last year my father passed away, and while it was emotionally difficult, I realized that figuring out the logistics of one's passing was also challenging. In preparing for the worst with the Coronavirus, I started to think about what needs to be done in case I die (crossing my fingers that I won't).

## Closing out accounts

One of the main challenges after my father passed was to figure out which accounts he had, what bills were unpaid, what money remained in different accounts, and how to log in to everything.

If you know someone's email password, you can usually reset every password this way. Security-wise, this means you should guard your email password with critical security. Fortunately, my father passed away slowly due to stomach cancer and could relay the password to my sister in the hospital. But if you die suddenly, and you're the only one who knows the password, it might be really challenging for others to secure access to this account.

After I secured access to his Gmail account, I started looking for keywords like payment or bill or invoice and made a list of all the various accounts, services, sites, etc. Fortunately, my dad didn't have a lot of online accounts, so it was fairly easy to arrive at a full view of everything. One by one my sister and I would close accounts. Some accounts, such as a recurring iTunes subscription for $9.99 a month, I'm guessing he probably didn't even know about (turns out my wife also had this recurring subscription and didn't realize it).

In my case, I have a lot more logins to various sites and services. I'm using a password manager to store and manage access to all of these accounts, but even so, there hundreds of different logins to different sites, ranging from critical sites that include banks to trivial ones like Reddit.

To facilitate any needed transition, I installed the password manager on my wife's computer and relayed a printout of login instructions to her, keeping it in a safe place in case of emergency. This should facilitate access to accounts.

The second task we performed was to list all recurring payments and services. We should've already had this in a carefully tracked budget, but we did not. We made a list of everything, including the monthly/yearly fees.

Third, I made sure sure one could log in to each service by looking for the information in the password manager.

This seems rather basic information, but trust me that the logistics of closing out accounts can take a long time.

One detail family members will be keen to know is whether any accounts have significant sums of money that can be dispensed. When my dad passed, we were wondering if there was some hidden account that had a stockpile of money he had kept. He was kind of closed off like this and had lived somewhat miserly most of his life, so we didn't know. He said there wasn't any such account. However, he did have a health savings account with several thousand dollars that he wasn't aware of.

## Access to benefits

Another consideration would be access to benefits. Depending on how you die, your life insurance policies might payout in different ways. How would your surviving family members even know how to access your life insurance policies, and what money might be coming their way?

For example, I have a death and dismemberment policy that I've enrolled in through work, especially knowing that a car could easily end my life while I'm biking, but how would my spouse or children know who to contact or how to request such benefits? One hopes that there's a process already in place for companies to transact benefits automatically, but it would be good to keep this information somewhere convenient. Even accessing one's benefits would require login to a corporate VPN.

## Burial wishes

Another question others will likely ask is to understand your burial wishes. When my father passed, we weren't sure if he would be fine with cremation or burial. We scanned through old emails and identified a previous thread where he mentioned that cremation would be okay. Since he was former military, he had already picked out his cemetery and described plans for burial. (By the way, the military really takes care of service members who pass in this regard.)

You can create your own will at [doyourownwill.com](https://www.doyourownwill.com/), where you can specify some basics such as who your estate should be transferred to, who should become the guardian of your children if both you and your spouse pass, how you wish to be buried, whether you want a funeral or memorial service, and so forth.

I know that my mother (still living) wishes to be cremated and then have her ashes scattered in a memorable place where we can always remember her. If you have some kind of specific request like this, do other family members know? They will likely want direction around this.

Another detail is whether you want to be kept alive on a ventilator even if you have no brain activity, and for how long. Can family members "pull the plug," and if so, how and when?

## Writing an obituary

Another detail family members will need to do is write an obituary. It turns out that publishing obituaries in newspapers costs hundreds of dollars (I thought they were free). But even if you just want a short obituary to publish in a memorial service brochure, someone will have to write it, and they will need some basic facts. Here is the [short obituary I wrote about my dad](https://idratherbewriting.com/blog/obituary-for-my-dad-1935-2018/). Writing the obituary is therapeutic and emotional, but there are also factual details to include:

* Dates and places of birth
* Names of parents and siblings
* General outline of major life events
* Career details
* Hobbies and interests
* Character descriptions and personalities

You'll also probably need a collection of photos for the memorial service.


## Helping others find closure

My dad was somewhat of a loner. He read a lot and had some deep thoughts, but he didn't open up a lot and share himself with others by default. We also had a lifelong rift because I had joined the Mormon church in my teens and had been a member for a good 20 years before leaving in my late thirties. His brother had been a Mormon and had goaded him constantly in self-righteous ways, even though his brother had also been excommunicated. Anyway, while going through his email, I ran across one email written in 2006, to his brother, that made me feel good about these rougher times. He wrote,

> Tom and I have been going fishing in Tampa Bay. We caught quite a few the other day. What I know about fishing I learned in the west. It's a lot different here. The water is shallower and there's a lot more kinds of fish, all with special rules about when they're legally catchable, how long they have to be, etc. We're starting slow and learning as we go. It's fun to be with my wonderful son. Age 30, good Mormon, good job as a writer, teaches school one night a week, and creates web sites for money in his spare time. An all around nice guy. An excellent father, too.

In thinking about your death, helping others find closure might be one of the most difficult challenges. Are there open emotional wounds with others? Do some family members feel like they aren't your favorites, or that you've neglected or estranged them somehow? I'm not sure what the right approach is to help them find closure, but maybe writing a letter to them that they should read upon death could be helpful. This isn't something I've done but it could be good to do.

## Other details

This topic isn't a pleasant one to contemplate, but it's certainly sobering, and with so many people dying of Coronavirus, with plans to reopen the economy (whereupon deaths might soar even more), these details are worth thinking about. Given that as technical writers we write instructions for a living, this is one user manual that could likely be the most important user manual you ever write. Imagine that upon dying, your family members find a bound instruction book, with a table of contents that lays out everything they'll need to do, in step by step fashion. It would be a fitting complement to a life spent writing instructions for complex systems, and one manual that would have more impact than any other.
