CS
why do you want to devote yourself to one project? essential for moving up to a SME like level of knowledge. i like having expertise rather than sort of swimming in misundertstanding.
what would you hope to accomplish? proficiency. expertise. knowledge and power.
what are some of the downfalls? not sure. **but once you are an expert, this sort of accommodates all other types of writing. i could easily kick out blog psts and other stuff without trouble.**
how does the analogy with your kids play out? not sure. in some ways, not sure. probably a false analogy.
is this part of the examined life thing? what does that mean? yeah, i like to go deep. that is way more fun.
is this not swinging back towards the specialization topic? yeah i think so.
how could you conceivably pull this off?  can't ignore the other projects entirely, but what if you could jsut play a supportive role only
can you do a shitty job on some and a bangup job on others? yeah.
how do you know that you're even doing a good job? you feel it.
is there some benefit to cross-pollination? yeah but maybe it's marginal.

think back to that post where you wrote about your best days as a technical writer. that is one of your favorite posts.

in that post, i talked about becoming a user champion. impossible to do this without really having any bandwidth at all to ramp up on user details. there is a strong need to become immersed and familiar with users, but if you don't have this time, then your role gets shortchanged and devalued. if you're alway sjust writing content and making language pretty, you become less and less interesting.
