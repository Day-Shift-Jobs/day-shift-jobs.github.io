The five approaches covered in this article are as follows:

> Approach 1: Separate the “how” into inline comments, the “why” into external docs
> Approach 2: Juxtaposed commentary in a third column
> Approach 3: The Lego approach
> Approach 4: The Nautilus approach
> Approach 5: Interactive browser experiences
