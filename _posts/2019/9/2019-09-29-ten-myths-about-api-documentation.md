<h2> 10 myths about API documentation</h2>

1. You must read source code to write docs.
2. You'll need extrapolate sample code from one language to create code samples in another.
3. You must be a former engineer to be competitive in the API doc space.
4. Technical writers create the reference material.
5. All job interviewers care about, when it comes to API doc jobs, is technical know-how.
6. Developers can and will write if you implement a docs-as-code process.
7. Developers are most suited to write documentation for other developers.
8. API documentation and developer documentation are synonymous.
9. Docs that look good are good.
10. People will respect you more if the word "writer" isn't in your job title.

In the podcast, I mentioned this NY Times article: [In the Salary Race, Engineers Sprint but English Majors Endure](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/business/liberal-arts-stem-salaries.html).
