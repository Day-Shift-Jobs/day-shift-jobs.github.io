I've been thinking about a quote I once heard related to writing &mdash; that every novel is a monster you battle, or something. I couldn't find the original quote, but the idea of writing projects being monsters that you go up against couldn't be more perfect a description for a recent project of mine.

I feel like I'm a pretty good technical writer, but recently I found myself in full battle with a project monster. I was picking up the pieces of some documentation sketched out (I wouldn't say written) by another person (not a tech writer), who had since left the company (somewhat abruptly).

It seemed that all the knowledgeable people were tucked away in some other priority, in another state and part of the company. Those who did make themselves available didn't have the knowledge to help. Even the QA team shrugged their shoulders when I requested an end-to-end walkthrough. So I tried to figure it out on my own. And I found myself banging my head against the wall. How is this thing configured? Is there some backend process I'm not seeing? How does it actually work? Does it even work?

When I finally did get past an initial hurdle (thanks to some benevolent field engineer who took pity on me and threw me some nuggets of knowledge), I found myself up against another obstacle. Why won't this sample implementation work? If I can't even get it to work, how can I possibly expect users to make it work for them? I found myself going in circles, not getting anywhere.

I tried to put off the project, but it kept coming back to me, higher priority than before. Docs were essential for this product, and it was a high priority goal all the way up the leadership chain -- I returned again to it. But as I was focusing my full energy on it, I couldn't seem to break through. Why did the secrets of this project keep eluding me? What was I missing?

This project consumed me with frustration that turned into mild depression. I felt no energy to blog. I lost energy for conversation. I started to lose some confidence in myself. Frustrated and at my wits end, I fired off an email to a product head about being "blocked" (the magic word, really, in engineering) until I could get a sample implementation working. The product head listened. He allocated his smartest engineer to help me, and after an hour on the phone, sharing screens, holy schmoly the sample finally worked!

This breakthrough led to other breakthroughs, and I could observe the logs for each interaction, and little by little I unraveled the secret behind the product. I could finally see how it ticked, and how all the pieces (figuratively pinned on a mental wall by an insane detective) started to fit together and make sense.

I still have a lot of work to go, but I feel like I understand the product's secret, and I can now make progress in the tech writing.

Not all projects are monsters to battle, for sure. Some projects are just annoying and tedious. But more often than not, complex technical writing projects are monsters we battle. They are riddles that we have to solve. We might have to learn some technical language or framework to make progress, meet with engineers, re-listen to recordings of meetings, sift through QA test scripts, logs, and other sessions before things start to make sense. But at some point the product seems to unlock, and we understand key concepts, and this empowers our ability to write.

Although I'm writing about tech comm projects, I'm betting that fiction writers encounter similar monsters. Only instead of understanding how a product works, they rack their brains to understand how character's mind works, how plots fit together, motivations and psychology and interactions and such. I don't write fiction (at least not intentionally in docs), but I can see overlap here.

By the way, the one quote about monsters that I did find is from Nietzsche, who happens to be my favorite philosopher. Nietzsche says,

> He who fights with monsters might take care lest he also become a monster. And when you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you. (Beyond Good and Evil, Aphorism 146)

The meaning here is a little more straightforward and potentially unrelated. If some feral monster is trying to kill you, you'll likely need to become a feral monster yourself (and kill that person) to survive. Battling monsters often requires you to abandon your high ethics and gentlemenly ways and paint your face with black warpaint and scream like a wild man, or something. (I think Nietzsche might be taking a jab at turn-your-cheek ethics here. I'm not sure.)

Certainly, when you find yourself with a new, highly complex, confusing, and  intimidatingly technical project for which you must write clear and user-friendly documentation, it is like staring into Nietzsche's abyss. Does this abyss have the potential to fill your own soul with a similar abyss? Is this descension into madness somehow required in order to defeat madness, as Nietzsche says? Do you have to become a monster to defeat a monster?

Maybe. I've been binge-watching a show on Netflix lately called *Outlander*. In it, one of the characters, after a traumatic and humiliating experience, descends into a darkness from which he can't seem to recover. He stops eating and lies inert in his bed week after week while his wife stands by, not understanding how to help. Someone finally tells her that if she wants to save her husband, she'll have to descend into the darkness with him. So she does, more or less, nearly taking her own life. And it works.

I'm not sure if Nietzsche is entirely relevant here, or if filling your soul with an abyss or darkness or becoming a monster is somehow necessary to defeat a project monster in tech comm. But perhaps there's something to this idea.

In the tech comm experience I related above, frustration pushed me to my threshold. I hit a point where I couldn't make any progress, and I started to go mad. It caused me to reach out in an aggressive way to the product head to unblock me.

Maybe with project monsters, you have to step up your level of assertiveness and aggressiveness. When QA sort of shrugged their shoulders at me, maybe I should have come unhinged and escalated this. Oh, so you don't actually test the product end to end, but you certify it for release nonetheless? *Incompetent fool!*

I'm not sure that going berserk or Rambo-like in these scenarios (turning into the monster) will really help me defeat a figurative project monster, but perhaps by becoming a stalker and following key project people's activities online (inside the firewall), becoming obsessive and immersed in learning about the project's technology (maybe just spending an entire week on lynda.com), canceling all meetings on your calendar for one month out, shutting off your email and messaging clients entirely, inviting yourself to meetings you're not invited to, scheduling high-level engineers to give full-day trainings for your benefit, meeting with leaders 3 or 4 levels above you to discuss priorities, convincing your boss to bribe key engineers with a parade of gifts, devoting your full mental attention to each small detail until you understand every angle of it, combing meticulously through support logs and customer relationship databases for information and clues, working late into the night when you catch a trail of information, mapping out every single person related to the project and how they relate and interact, relentlessly emailing people about every unanswered question and and again -- I don't know, all of this seems mad, out of the ordinary, but maybe this kind of obsessive, semi-insane, questionable, over-the-top behavior is what's needed to kill a project monster?

In short, for complex technical projects, the monsters we battle, maybe Nietzsche is right here. We have to become a monster to kill the monster.
