If you're thinking of [advertising on idratherbewriting.com](/advertising/), it's important to get a  sense of the traffic and analytics of the audience so that your ad not only has visibility, but visibility with the right audience.

In 2018, idratherbewriting.com had an average of 1,552,615 page views, or about 4,250 page views a day. More specifically, users created 942,306 sessions, with 1.65 pages per session and an average of 1:44 minutes per session. I update the information here each after diving deep into the information from Google Analytics.

## Analytics

Here's a breakdown of site traffic analytics on idratherbewriting.com from Jan 1, 2018 through Dec 31, 2018, according to Google Analytics.

<figure><img src="https://idratherbewritingmedia.com/images/googleanalytics2019-overall.png"  alt="I&#039;d Rather Be Writing received 1,552,615 page views during 2018, or 4,253 page views a day." /> <figcaption>I'd Rather Be Writing gets about 1,552,615 page views per year, or 4,253 page views a day.</figcaption></figure>

Here's another slice of analytics focusing more on audience:

<figure><img src="https://idratherbewritingmedia.com/images/google-analytics2019-audience.png" alt="Breakdown of analytics" /> <figcaption>Here you can see a breakdown of sessions. During 2018, there were about 942,000 sessions, with users viewing 1.65 pages per session. </figcaption></figure>

{{site.data.alerts.note}}A "page view" is when the page loads, regardless of whether it's the same visitor or a different visitor. A "session" refers to a <i>unique visit</i> to the site. If the same visitor views 10 pages, it only counts as a single session. The average number of page views per session is 1.65.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## API doc traffic percentage

In 2018, the majority of traffic came to my [API documentation site](/learnapidoc/):

<figure><img src="https://idratherbewritingmedia.com/images/learnapidocmetrics.png" alt="API documentation traffic" /> <figcaption></figcaption>About 59% of traffic to my site goes to my <a href='https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/'>API documentation site. The rest pretty much does to my blog.</a></figure>

The traffic from the API documentation visitors is outperforming other traffic sources. This represents a potentially new audience to which you can market tech comm solutions.

## Growth from the previous year

I'd Rather Be Writing received significantly more traffic in 2018 (nearly double the page views) than the previous year. The blue line represents 2018, while the brown line represents 2017.

<figure><img src="https://idratherbewritingmedia.com/images/googleanalytics-2017-2018-comparison.png" alt="Traffic comparison by year" /> <figcaption></figcaption>Traffic comparison by year</figure>

The increased traffic from the API documentation site probably accounts for the massive growth.

## Top 10 pages overall (across all sites)

Here are the top 10 overall pages that received the most traffic last year. (The pages weren't necessarily written during 2018.)

1.  [Swagger UI tutorial](/learnapidoc/pubapis_swagger.html) (12%)
2.  [Documenting APIs: A guide for technical writers](/learnapidoc/) (5%)
3.  [Step 3: Parameters (API reference tutorial)](/learnapidoc/docapis_doc_parameters.html) (4%)
4.  [I'd Rather Be Writing: Latest posts](/) (4%)
5.  [Submit requests through Postman](/learnapidoc/docapis_postman.html) (3%)
6.  [Quick Reference Guide Templates](/quickreferenceguides/) (2%)
7.  [10 realizations as I was creating my Swagger spec and Swagger UI](/2015/12/10/ten-realizations-using-swagger-and-swagger-ui/) (1%)
8.  [OpenAPI 3.0 tutorial overview](/learnapidoc/pubapis_openapi_tutorial_overview) (1%)
9.  [JavaScript: Events and Listeners](/events-and-listeners-javascript/) (1%)
10. [Inspect the JSON from the response payload](/learnapidoc/docapis_json_console.html) (1%)

Again, these top pages show that most of the traffic is coming through my [API documentation site](/learnapidoc/), with [Swagger UI tutorial](/learnapidoc/pubapis_swagger.html) leading the way.

## Age and gender

The breakdown of audience age and gender is as follows:

<figure><img src="https://idratherbewritingmedia.com/images/googleanalytics-age-and-gender.png" alt="Age and gender breakdown" /> <figcaption>There are twice as many males as females reading my site. This demographic reflects the more male-centric programmer culture.</figcaption> </figure>

## Quality of impressions

The quality of impressions depends on the influence of the site. Impressions from a highly influential site carry more weight than impressions from a less influential site.
