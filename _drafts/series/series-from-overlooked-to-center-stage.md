description: "<p>Several years ago I gave a keynote to a conference in Georgia titled <i>From Overlooked to Center Stage</i>. This series of posts is essentially the framework for my talk. I tell the story about how technical writers play an increasingly broad range of roles, from quality assurance to product design to training to support to usability and more. </p><p>What happens when you play so many roles? Do you spread yourself too thin and become incapable of delivering on your core product (for example, help material), or do all of these supporting/ancillary activities strengthen and enhance your ability to deliver help material that is more on target with the needs of your audience?</p><p>My answer is that wearing multiple hats brings both good and bad results, but mostly good.</p>"
