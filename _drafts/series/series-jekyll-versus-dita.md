permalink: /series-jekyll-versus-dita/
description: "In this series, I look at two major authoring paradigms. DITA represents the structured authoring paradigm common in tech comm departments. Jekyll represents a static site generator method that is more common with web publishing and front-end development. I'm not really trying to compare two specific tools but instead to look at how tech comm traditionally approaches publishing in contrast to how web publishing tools do publishing."
