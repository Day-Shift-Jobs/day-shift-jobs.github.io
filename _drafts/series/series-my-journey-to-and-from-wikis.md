description: "This series on wikis explores the appeal of wikis and collaboration, my involvement in working on a wiki in a somewhat large community of volunteers, and why I eventually decided wikis weren't the best option for me. I get in depth with some features in Mediawiki, challenges with collaboration, some pitfalls with wikis, and more."
